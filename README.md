## How to use

The library is contained within the ```cudaRNN``` namespace. The workflow is very straightforward and similar to TensorFlow.

- Initialize the structure ```cudaRNN::RNNOptions_t```
- Instantiate ```cudaRNN::RNN``` using the previous structure. This class is templatized with 2 arguments: the first one refers to the data type of the inputs and targets (```int, float, or double```), and the second one to the data type of the weights (```__half, float or double```).
- Initialize inputs, which should be ordered as ```[inLength, nSequences, inVecSize]```, and targets as ```[outLength, nSequences, inVecSize]```, by using the methods ```setInputs``` and ```setTargets```.
- Select an optimizer and a loss metric through ```setOptimzer``` and ```setMetrics``` (optional).
- Call ```train```.
